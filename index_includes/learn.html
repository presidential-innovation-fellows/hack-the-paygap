      <h3>What is "Opportunity?"</h3>
      <p>
        Opportunity is thought of as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>access to the resources and services that a family, individual, or community needs to thrive, and</li>
        <li>freedom from the stressors that detract from the family, individual, or community's ability to thrive.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What's been happening?</h3>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>In early 2016, the White House, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the U.S. Department Housing and Urban Development facilitated a process in which tech developers worked with subject matter experts and cities to build digital tools that help families, community leaders, local officials, and the media to access what they need to thrive.
      </p>
      <p>This effort culminated with a White House demo on March 7.</p>
